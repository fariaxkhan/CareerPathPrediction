Career Path Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict students' career paths in the field of business analytics based on their academic performance. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to classify students into potential career paths, either in technology or management.

Objective:

Classify students into potential career paths (technology or management) using a dataset of academic grades.
Provide data-driven insights to career counsellors and educational institutions for better resource allocation and guidance.
Enhance the accuracy of career path predictions through the application of a Random Forest model.
Key Features:

Data Collection and Preparation: Extract and preprocess grades from 200 student transcripts over six semesters.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze grade distributions and correlations to understand influences on career paths.
Model Building and Training: Implement the Random Forest algorithm to classify students based on their course grades.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
Results and Discussion: Discuss the implications of the findings for curriculum development and personalized student guidance.
Outcome:

The project provides a strategic approach to harness machine learning for career path prediction, enabling educational institutions to offer more tailored guidance and optimize resource allocation, thereby enhancing student satisfaction and success rates.
Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
